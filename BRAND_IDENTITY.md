## Our Story (Honest Positioning)

LuxDigital was founded in 2024 by digital marketing professionals who saw a need for transparent, honest digital marketing services in Luxembourg.

After years of working with agencies that over-promised and under-delivered, we decided to build something different: an agency that focuses on realistic goals, honest communication, and measurable results.

We're building our client portfolio by offering competitive rates and exceptional service. As a new agency, we're hungry to prove ourselves and committed to delivering results that speak for themselves.

## Team Structure (Small but skilled)

**Founder & Strategy Lead**: 10+ years digital marketing experience
**SEO Specialist**: Expert in multilingual SEO
**PPC Manager**: Certified Google & Meta Ads specialist
**Content Creator**: Native multilingual writer (FR/EN/DE)

We work with trusted freelance partners for design, development, and specialized services.

## What We DON'T Do

- Make unrealistic promises
- Guarantee rankings (no one can)
- Lock you into long contracts (month-to-month)
- Charge hidden fees
- Use black-hat tactics
- Inflate our numbers

## Our Commitment

- **Transparent Reporting**: You'll always know what we're working on
- **Realistic Expectations**: We set achievable goals
- **No Long-Term Contracts**: Month-to-month service (after 3-month minimum)
- **Your Success = Our Success**: We only grow when you grow

This is a realistic startup positioning that builds trust through honesty rather than fake statistics.
